    <h1>Why Black Cats Are The Best</h1>
    <p>
      This is Choco. We adopted him from the
      <a href="https://www.spcamc.org/">SPCA</a> last year in July. He was about
      3 weeks old when we adopted him and now he's a year old. He is a shorthair
      Bombay mixed with a Burmese.

    <h2>Unlucky?</h2>
    <p>
      They are not unlucky and have cute boba eyes. I used to be more of a dog
      person, but after we adopted Choco I changed my mind. My family had never
      had an offical pet until we adopted Choco.
